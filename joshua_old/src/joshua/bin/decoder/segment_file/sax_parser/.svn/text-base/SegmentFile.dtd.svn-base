<!--
	The actual constraints are very GADTish, but DTD cannot express these constraints. The three cases that are accepted are:
	
	(1) <constraint><lhs>...</lhs><rhs features="...">...</rhs></constraint>
		This is, essentially, defining a new rule according to the same style as the original grammar.
	
	(2) <constraint><lhs>...</lhs></constraint>
		This is always considered hard
	
	(3) <constraint><rhs>...</rhs></constraint>
		This acts as a filter on the original grammar.
