pro.config.example:	PRO configuration file example
run.sh.example:		PRO command line example
params.txt.example:	File specifying parameters to train
sparse_feat.example:	Sparse feature definition file example(only useful for training mode 2-4)
joshua.config.example:	Joshua decoder example file(for mode 2-4 only)

====== Requirement for the decoder ======
For training mode 2-4(in which sparse features are involved in training), the decoder is required to output the n-best file in the following format(sparse feature representation):

...
0 ||| a throbbing pain . ||| 1:-6.407 2:-0.000 3:-3.125 4:-1.181 5:-1.737 46:1 231:1 529:1 ||| -3.494
...

in which x:y(or x=y) means feature with index x has the value y.

Also, the decoder configuration file is supposed to include one line indicating the sparse file location and weights, for example:

...
discriminative ./sparse_feat.example 1.0
...

This line should match the line indicating the sparse feature file in "params.txt.example".

====== Classifier-specific command/config files ======

(average-perceptron:			built in PRO, no external files required)
stanford_maxent_prop_file.example:	Stanford MaxEnt classifier property file
megam_command.example:			MegaM classifier command line
libsvm_command.example:			LibSVM classifier command line

====== To use your own classifier =======

Simply implement the simple interface "joshua.pro.ClassifierInterface", see comments in the code.
