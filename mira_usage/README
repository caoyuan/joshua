====== Requirement for the decoder ======
For training mode 2-4(in which sparse features are involved in training), the decoder is required to output the n-best file in the following format(sparse feature representation):

...
0 ||| a throbbing pain . ||| 1:-6.407 2:-0.000 3:-3.125 4:-1.181 5:-1.737 46:1 231:1 529:1 ||| -3.494
...

in which x:y(or x=y) means feature with index x has the value y.

Also, the decoder configuration file is supposed to include one line indicating the sparse file location and weights, for example:

...
discriminative ./sparse_feat 1.0
...

This line should match the line indicating the sparse feature file in "params.txt".
