TikZ does not natively support logscale, so I ran the following 
transform on each file:

> cat ghkm.nts | awk '{print log($2)" "log($1)+0.2}' > ghkm.logscale.nts

Additionally, TikZ complained about the number of datapoints for
SAMT, so I randomly thinned out the datapoints in the densest part of
the graph (which still reads as completely packed on the plot). The plot
is otherwise faithful to the data.

> cat samt.logscale.nts | awk '{if ($1<5 || $1>9 || rand()<.3) {print $0}};' > samt.logscale.thinned.nts
